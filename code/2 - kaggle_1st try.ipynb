All game data includes the day number in order to make it easier to perform date calculations. If you really want to know the exact date a game was played on, you can combine the game's \"daynum\" with the season's \"dayzero\". For instance, since day zero during the 2011-2012 season was 10/31/2011, if we know that the earliest regular season games that year were played on daynum=7, they were therefore played on 11/07/2011.\n",

    "- DayZero - tells you the date corresponding to daynum=0 during that season. All game dates have been aligned upon a common scale so that Selection Monday is on day 133. All game data includes the day number in order to make it easier to perform date calculations. If you really want to know the exact date a game was played on, you can combine the game's \"daynum\" with the season's \"dayzero\". For instance, since day zero during the 2011-2012 season was 10/31/2011, if we know that the earliest regular season games that year were played on daynum=7, they were therefore played on 11/07/2011.\n",
    "- DayNum - this integer always ranges from 0 to 132, and tells you what day the game was played on. It represents an offset from the \"DayZero\" date in the \"Seasons.csv\" file. For example, the first game in the file was DayNum=20. Combined with the fact from the \"Seasons.csv\" file that day zero was 10/29/1984 that year, this means the first game was played 20 days later, or 11/18/1984. There are no teams that ever played more than one game on a given date, so you can use this fact if you need a unique key (combining Season and DayNum and WTeamID). In order to accomplish this uniqueness, we had to adjust one game's date. In March 2008, the SEC postseason tournament had to reschedule one game (Georgia-Kentucky) to a subsequent day, so Georgia had to actually play two games on the same day. In order to enforce this uniqueness, we moved the game date for the Georgia-Kentucky game back to its original scheduled date."
